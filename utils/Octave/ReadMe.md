Models
* BondswapAndAssociationDissociation.m  - calculation of sticker opening and closing rates, dependent on rates of bondswapping and association-dissociation.  
* StickyReptation.m - Linear viscoelasticity of sticky polymers modelled using a combination of Sticky Rouse and Double repation.  
* calcChainExtension: script to calculate chain extension of linear polymers (also implemented in the C code).

Modules  
* getDynamicModuli: Numerical methods to transform *G*(*t*) to *G*'(*w*) and *G*''(*w*).  
* DoubleReptation: Calculate moduli using des Cloizeaux's model for polymer reptation.
* Likhtman-McLeish: Numerical implementation of Likhtman-McLeish model.  
* StickyRouse: Calculate moduli using sticky Rouse model (series of Maxwell modes)
